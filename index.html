    <h1>My solution</h1>
    <h1 id="subtitle">What is Responsive Design?</h1>
    <p>It is a web design and development technique that through the use of flexible structures (flexible containers, flexible images and video) and together with Media Queries specified in CSS, manage to adapt a website to the environment of the device in which it is located. <br> 
        With this technique, the content of your site's design looks good and can be quite readable for users on the device with which it interacts. 
    </p>
    <h1 id="subtitle">Some Basic Concepts</h1>
    <p>Some basic concepts necessary to correctly understand Responsive Web Design. They are the following:<br>
        The first of them is the difference between <b>responsive design</b> and <b>adaptive design</b>. 
        A responsive design responds at all times to the dimensions of the device, while an adaptive design is one that adapts, but does not necessarily respond at all times.<br>

        On the other hand, to work correctly in responsive designs, we must bear in mind that we must work with relative units.
